Georgia, Birch, Maple and Dylan were sitting around Campfire Rock looking at all the ants. Some were carrying dead insects, others were scurrying up and down a birch tree; all of them seemed so busy.

Maple said “That poor ant is having an awful time carrying that dead wasp. I wonder if we could help it?”

Birch said “Let’s shrink down to ant size and give it a hand.” They all thought this was a good idea. Georgia went to get the Boletus minimus and the Boletus Maximus. Maple went for flash lights just in case they were needed. Dylan remembered how they could hardly find each other last time they nibbled the Boletus minimus and went for some string that they could all hold onto as they shrunk down to ant size.

Soon they were ready and Georgia made sure they each had some Boletus Maximus in their pocket.

Dylan passed the string around and Birch said “Let’s do it.”

They all took a big bite of the Boletus minimus and soon they had shrunk down to ant size and were face to face with the ant that was trying to carry the enormous dead wasp.

The ant was waving his antennae around in front of her - it seemed very scary.

Birch said “We are here to help you carry that dead wasp back to your ant colony.”

“Oh” said the ant. “If you are going to help me, you are going to have to smell like me. All the ants in our colony have the same smell; if you don’t smell like me one of my sisters may attack you. Did you know that every ant in our colony is a sister of mine?”

Georgia asked “How can that be?”

The ant said “Our Queen went on a mating flight over 10 years ago, she mated with a male who died after mating with our Queen and providing her with enough sperm to lay eggs all these years. And every fertilzed egg she lays is a female and hence a sister of mine!”

Birch said “Let us help you carry that wasp. How do you know where to go.”

The ant said “I will first spray you with my odor so that all my sisters will know that you are friends.” And she did. “Can you smell the scent trail on the ground - that will lead us back to the colony.”

Dylan said “I can smell it now. The ant lifted up the front of the wasp and Georgia, Birch, Maple and Dylan lifted up the back of the wasp and they followed the ant towards the colony. After a long walk in which they crossed Campfire Rock and made their way down a dirt path, then came to a mound with many entrances. The wasp was too large for the hole. The ant sent out a signal and many of her sisters came over. They all waved their antennae - this was scary - but after sensing that everyone had the right smell, they started cutting up the wasp into smaller pieces with their mandibles.

Maple asked “Where will you take the wasp pieces?”

The ant said, “We have food storage rooms. Would you like to see them?”

Dylan and Maple were nervous. But Birch and Georgia were keen, so they all pulled out their flash lights and followed the ant into the ground. They passed a number of chambers.

Georgia enquired “What was in them?”

The ant said that after the queen has layed eggs, we move them to a nursery where they hatch out after a few days into larvae - white worm like creatures. We will feed them - in a couple of weeks, they spin a cocoon, which is a bit like a sleeping bag, and some three weeks later they will hatch out looking just like me.”

Dylan and Maple were getting more and more nervous the further they went into the tunnel, so Birch and Georgia agreed that they should return to the surface. The ant was very kind and guided them out.

When they reached the entrance, they found it blocked by feathers.

The ant said “There are good birds such as grouse and bad birds such as woodpeckers. The good birds take a dust bath on our colony and they want us to climb among their feathers and eat the lice living on their feathers. The bad birds stick their long sticky tongues into our colony and snatch and eat my sisters. This is a grouse, it is a good bird. Would you like to eat some lice?”

They looked at each other and screwed up their faces. They each shook their heads, vigorously - no one wanted to eat lice!

Georgia said “Thank you so much for the tour. It is time for us to go.”

They all reached into their pockets and pulled out a piece of Boletus Maximus and ate it. They gave the grouse such a start as they grew back to normal size, that it flew quickly away!

Birch said “That was fun even if it was a little scary.”

Maple said, “ I wonder what we would have learned if we had met an ant who going up that birch tree?” That is another story.

A poem by Ogden Nash
The ant has made himself industrious
Through constant industry industrious
So what?
Would you be calm and placid
If you were full of Formic acid?
