It was time for the fabulous foursome to have a new adventure. Georgia, Birch, Dylan and Maple set out from the cabin on Besnard Lake to walk around the island. Georgia, who often took the lead in such endeavours, suggested that they play pirates.

“Ooh, that would be cool,” said Birch.

“I wanna meet a real pirate,” demanded Dylan. Maple was so so about the idea but decided to go along with the others.

No sooner had they left Rocky Beach and arrived at Stony Beach when they came upon all kinds of wood, washed up on to the shore.

“Whoa,” cried Birch. “Look at that! Where do you think it came from?”

Maple, who was the most sensible of the four said, “It’s obviously a broken up boat, washed ashore in the storm we had yesterday.”

“Who do you think was in it?” asked Georgia.

Birch replied, “Pirates, of course.”

Dylan said, “I wanna meet a real pirate.”

The four of them looked around but couldn’t find a trace of anyone or anything except for the pile of wood. They kept walking toward Sandy Beach. But on the ground Maple spotted part of an orange peel. “It’s not good to throw litter on the ground. I’ll pick it up and take it back to the cabin for the compost pail.” They walked on. Soon they spotted another piece of orange peel.

Georgia was the first to suspect someone was dropping the orange peels so that whomever followed would find them. “I think it’s a pirate,” she said.

“Cool,” said Birch.

Maple was more concerned about the garbage this person was leaving behind. Maple liked neatness and she liked it when people left the woods clean, just the way it should be. Her family, including Travis, Stacey, and of course Birch, had camped a lot and they always left their campsite just as clean as when they’d found it.

“Shhh, “ said Georgia. “I hear something.” They all stopped in their tracks. Sure enough there was a noise coming from the woods at Peter’s Point. Quietly, carefully, they creeped along toward the noise. There in a clearing sat a man. No, not just a man. A pirate!

“Hello there, my little ones!” he cried. “Found me, did you?”

Dylan, who was not afraid of anything or anybody, and who had not an ounce of common sense in her, walked up to the man and said, “Are you a REAL pirate? I wanna meet a real pirate.”

“Do I look like a real pirate to you, little one? Why else would I be wearing this weird hat, have a black patch over my eye and wear this red handkerchief around my neck with white polka dots? Of course I’m a real pirate.”

“Whoa,” Birch said, not too sure about this situation. Georgia, who had more experience in the world than the other 3 wasn’t too sure either. Perhaps they should run away.

But Maple, the sensible one, decided to sit down and ask the man some questions. “Where do you come from? Why are you here? How did you get here? Are you leaving the orange peels behind? You shouldn’t do that, you know.”

“Man, what a lot of questions this little one asks! First of all, did you see all that wood on that beach back there? Yesterday there was a huge storm on the lake and my boat, which wasn’t too seaworthy after my trip down the Churchill River, broke up. Luckily I found this island.” He went on, “Yes, I’m from Hudson Bay where big ships travel in the summer. I came down the Churchill River and left it when I got to this Besnard Lake. I’d heard the fishing is really good here. But then this storm happened and here I am!”

“Where are you going to go? What are you going to eat,” asked Birch.

Georgia also wanted to know, “Where are you going to sleep?”

Dylan chimed in with, “Are you sure you’re a REAL pirate?”

“Not sure about all those answers but for now I’ll sleep in the woods here. I’m used to that. I managed to save some food from my boat and I can always eat fireweed and berries and cook up some nettles for soup. And as for being a real pirate, I guess I’m as close as one can come in these days,”. Dylan seemed satisfied.

The fearsome foursome sat and listened to the pirate tell stories of the Hudson Bay, the Churchill and his escapades. After what seemed like a long time, Maple said, “We should help Mr. Pirate fix his boat so he could get back on his way.”

Georgia said, “What a good idea. We could use birch bark and spruce gum to help fix the cracks.”

The pirate said, “Do you think you could really help me fix my boat?”

“Sure!” they all cried together. Birch and Dylan were enthusiastic too. So they all went back to Stoney Beach and pulled all the boat pieces of wood out of the water. For the rest of the day they worked hard on fixing the boat. Finally, in late afternoon, the pirate got into the boat and it floated! He got his oars and started rowing away from the island. “You kids are the best ever! Thanks so much for helping me out.” Everyone waved and wished him well.

Then sensible Maple said, “We’ve got to be getting back to the cabin. Our parents and Grandpa Peter and Granny Nikki will wonder where we are.” They all waved Good Bye again to the pirate. “Maybe we’ll see you again.”

“Do you think he was a really REAL pirate?” Dylan asked Birch.

“I dunno. But our parents will sure be amazed to hear about him.”

They all took the main trail back to the cabin, past various benches. Soon they saw the cabin and heard people talking.

“You’ll never guess what we saw and who we met!” They all yelled at once.

“We met a pirate,” Birch exclaimed.

“He was a REAL pirate,” declared Dylan.

“He left orange peels along the trail,” accused Maple.

“And he’s from Hudson Bay and came down the Churchill River to Besnard!” explained Georgia.

“What an adventure!” The adults cried. “We wish we had met him. You did real good helping him out.”

That night the kids dreamt about the pirate and in their dreams they imagined him going back up the Churchill and back to Hudson Bay.
