We rejoin the fearless foursome and their new friends as they climb up the winding tunnel that leads to the top of the castle. It was arduous going through the tunnel; while the Hook, Cook, Book, Teddy and Tubby could scurry along on four feet, the fearless foursome had to crawl on all fours to avoid hitting their heads on the tunnel roof. And Maple was having a difficult time shining the flashlight while crawling along on only three limbs! Georgia noticed lots of tunnels heading off from the main tunnel and called out “Momma, where do all these tunnels lead?”

Momma said “We will take this side tunnel and I will show you.” She scurried along for quite a few vole lengths and then took a turn through some pink bedding.

Dylan said “This is scratchy.” Momma had a nice fur coat and did not feel the pink bedding as itchy at all. They could see light at the end of the tunnel and took turns peaking through a small hole - too small to let a vole through.

Momma said “This is where the giants live.” Maple saw Stacey at the stove cooking supper. Momma went on “There is lots of good food there but it is difficult to get to.” She went on “Unfortunately we voles have a difficult time holding our poop and we leave evidence whereever we have been. Our calling cards – so to speak! Every time we find a way in, the giants notice we have been there; they put out traps and block off our entrance if they find it.”

Hook wondered “Could I make my home here momma?”

“You could son. But it would be a long way for you to go for water and food each day.”

Momma let them back to the main tunnel and they continued ascending. The fearless foursome were getting tired. Maple asked “How much further?”

Momma replied “We are almost there.” Just then the tunnel leveled off and they could see light coming from several openings. At one opening they could see down to the ocean and there was granny Nikki swimming! Hanging upside down just above the opening was Batty, a little brown bat. Batty was fast asleep. Momma said he sleeps all day and goes out hunting for insects at night. If we voles could fly like Batty, we would all move back into the castle as it would be so much safer and we would have a good food supply.”

A little further on, they met the Sprucekins, a squirrel family. Momma said “The Sprucekins only moved in a few years ago. They used to live in nests in spruce trees as their main food is the seeds found in pine and spruce cones. However a martin made its way to the island and ate many squirrels. The Sprucekins found their own entrance to the castle and have lived here ever since. Fortunately, martins are too big to get down a vole hole. I am much more afraid of weasels as they are small enough so that they can attack us in our homes. Luckily, it has been a long time since a weasel has been spotted.”

Near the Sprucekins nest, there was a crack in the floor. Georgia, Birch, Dylan and Maple each took turns looking through the crack at Stacey cooking supper. It smelled good and they were all hungry after their big climb. When they were finished looking, they turned around and realized that Momma, Hook, Tubby, Teddy, Book and Cook had all disappeared!

To be continued.
