Grandpa Peter discovered the secret garden unexpectedly one day as he strolled through the middle of the island. All of a sudden there were beautiful pink flowers everywhere. “Lady slippers,” he said to himself. Rare and very beautiful lady slippers. They were orchids that grew in the wild. The lady slipper is named thus because the flower looks like a lady’s slipper. Soft and curved. Enveloping the imaginary foot.

As Grandpa looked more closely at the flowers, he saw something that startled him. Inside each flower were tiny little sparkles of light, flitting to and fro. “What can that be?” He wondered. He checked each and very flower and the little lights were in each flower. “I wish Georgia and Birch were here so that could get closer to the flower and tell me what is happening in these flowers.” But Georgia and Birch were miles away. So Grandpa was on his own. He decided to visit the garden that night and see if the lights were still shining.

The sunsets very late on the island where Grandpa was. So it wasn’t until nearly 11 PM that he got back to the secret garden. Indeed he saw that not only were there little lights twinkling in the flowers, they were twinkling everywhere! Out on the moss, on top of the fallen branches on the ground, in the pine trees nearby. “What was going on here?” Grandpa was enchanted.

All of a sudden one of the twinkly lights jumped onto Grandpa’s shoulder and started jumping and twirling around. “Come join us,“ invited the twinkling light. Grandpa wasn’t sure. But he thought it couldn’t hurt so he started jumping and twirling around too. He felt foolish doing it but he also felt light, and happy, and magical. Around and around he went. Until he got dizzy and fell to the ground. It took him a while to recover but when he did he saw that all the lights were surrounding him, as if they wanted to make sure he was all right. He told them he was fine.

The next day Grandpa went back to the secret garden. Again the lights were shining. But it was at night that Grandpa liked the garden best. That is when the lights were the most beautiful and when he enjoyed dancing with the lights. After that first day, Grandpa went to the secret garden every chance he got. He knew it was a magical place that only he knew about.

Grandpa is only telling you about the secret garden now because he didn’t think anyone would believe him. But Grandpa is getting old and he wants Georgia and Birch, Dylan and Maple to know about the secret garden. One day, maybe you’ll discover the secret garden on the island. And remember Grandpa jumping and twirling. And maybe you’ll jump and twirl too.
