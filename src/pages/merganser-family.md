It was a cold, windy, and grey day at the lake. Granny Nikki walked around the island, like she did every morning. Over at Sandy Beach (you all remember Sandy Beach don’t you?), where she liked to sit on the bench and have half of an orange as she looked out at the beauty of the lake and the islands across the way, she heard a strange sound. It was a scratching sound. But it was loud and it sounded like some animal was trying to get out of an enclosure of some sort. Granny was a little bit scared because she was always wondering if a bear had made it to the island. Could such a thing be making the sound? But as she sat on the bench she started to figure out where the sound was coming from.

There was this box. It was a big box, about the size of a microwave oven. Except it was attached to a tree and it was vertical, not horizontal (your parents can explain what that means). And in the front of the box was a hole. About the size of your fist. At first Granny didn’t think the sound was coming from the box. Because Grandpa Peter had built the box and it was for ducks, coming to nest. Unfortunately no ducks had ever nested in any of the boxes he’d built. Well one did, once, but that’s another story. So Granny didn’t think that there was a duck in the box. But something was making that scratching noise. And it did seem to be coming from the box. She thought it might have been a squirrel that had gotten into the box by being too curious and now couldn't get out again. “I’ll have to go and get Grandpa Peter. He’ll know how to get the squirrel out of the box.” As she got up to leave the bench, all of a sudden a female duck, called a merganser, flew out of the box and headed for the water.

“It was a duck!” Granny Nikki exclaimed. She quickly returned to the cabin and told Grandpa Peter what had happened. “Let’s hope that duck nests in that box,” Grandpa Peter said.

As time went by, Granny and Grandpa returned to that bench at Sandy Beach many times. But they never saw that duck again. Until one day, many weeks later, as Granny sat there, she heard peeps coming from somewhere. “The box!” She thought. “Those peeps are coming from the box.” Slowly but surely, out came a little duck. And then another. And then another. All told, 6 little ducks came out of the box and hopped down to the water. The mother duck was waiting for them. Granny watched as the mother and her six little ducks swam away. “How wonderful,” she thought. “That mother duck laid eggs in that box and the baby ducks were born!”

Over the summer Granny and Grandpa saw the merganser family on the water many times. Sometimes there were other little ducks with them because mergansers babysit each other’s ducklings. And every time Granny saw the family she remembered back to that day in the spring when she heard the mother scratching at the inside of the duck box. “All’s well that ends well,” she thought.
