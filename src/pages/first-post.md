Where to begin? We must start somewhere. Starting it the hardest thing. I think this quote is a fine place to starting, in chapter three while discussing how computers work the comment is made

> the machine processes bits of information according other bits, and as far as the machine is concerned there is no meaning to anything which happensâ€”it is we who attach meaning to the bits.

In medicine, we do not have math problems, but instead of medical problems. Many times the story of a problem will yield information, as will the physical exam. Then this is images from radiology and finally laboratory results. Many people want "all the labs," but in the context of the quote above. I would make the following analogy.

- Tests are like bits
- Test results are like the machine
- The doctor's interpretation creates meaning. In a vacuum, the results do not mean anything.
