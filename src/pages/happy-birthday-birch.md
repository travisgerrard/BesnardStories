We hope you have a wonderful birthday. Are you still camping on the Olympic forests?

If you were here with the other members of the fearless foursome, you might meet the cloud people in this adventure.

Georgia, Birch, Dylan and Maple were lying in the Secret Lady Slipper Garden. It was warm and sunny and there were some big cumulus clouds. It was peaceful in the garden and all were lying on their backs gazing up at the clouds moving across the sky. Birch said, “Look, there is a cloud person. How I wish I could float up and meet him.”

Amazing things happen in the Secret Lady Slipper Garden. The Lady Slippers had heard Birch’s Birthday wish and all of a sudden Birch started to float upwards.

Georgia wished that she could join Birch on his adventure. Alas, it wasn’t her birthday and she remained firmly on the ground. Georgia, Maple and Dylan watched as Birch floated higher and higher.

As Birch drifted upwards, he expanded to be bigger and bigger so that when the other members of the fearless foursome looked at him, he seemed to remain the same size to their eyes rather than getting smaller and smaller.

Birch felt light and airy. The higher he got the smaller his friends seemed. Soon he was up with the cloud people. He said, “What are your names?“

The biggest cloud said, “I’m Fluffy and my friend is Bounce.”

Birch said, “ Brr, it’s cold up here. How do you keep warm?”

Fluffy said, “We don’t want to get too warm. We are made of water molecules that have condensed. If you warmed us up too much we would evaporate and disappear.”

Maple, watching from below, saw that Birch was drifting way across the lake and asked, “How is Birch ever going to get back here?”

Dylan piped up, “I bet he makes friends with the cloud people and they help him.“

Birch looked down and saw that he was almost over Besnard Lake Lodge. He asked Fluffy and Bounce if they could blow him down to the ground near that lodge. They gave him a gentle puff and he started to descend slowly to the ground.

Georgia who had been following Birch with the binoculars, saw that he was coming down across the lake. She told Maple and Dylan to put their life jackets on. She put hers on and grabbed one for Birch. Then they all got into the boat 🚣‍♀️ and Georgia took them across to the lodge to pick up Birch.

As she was driving across she was pondering what wish she would make in the Secret Lady Slipper Garden on her birthday!
