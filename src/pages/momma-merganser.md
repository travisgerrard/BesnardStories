Maple was keeping track of the days since they had explored the castle. On the eighth day, she said to the others, “It is 8 days since we were in the castle. Momma merganser’s ducklings should be hatching out. Let’s check it out.”

The others agreed and Sarah issued out the Boletus minimus and the Boletus Maximus. Birch said, “We should shrink down to vole size. If we are too big we might scare Momma Merganser.”

Sarah said, “Good idea.” And they all took a good nibble.

After they had shrunk, Maple couldn’t see anyone. They had not brought a rope to tie themselves together. She called out, “I’m over here.”

Dylan was the first to find her. Soon Birch and Georgia had come along side also. They made there way under the cabin to Momma Merganser. She was sitting beside the nest watching the egg shells being cracked from the inside. 2 ducklings were already out - their down was wet and scraggly. Momma was proud. Dylan started to count the eggs and ducklings. One, two, three, four, five, seven, nine, eleven.”

Maple said let me count, “one, two , three, four, five, six, seven eight, nine. There are 2 ducklings and 7 eggs.”

Birch asked, “How long have you been sitting on your eggs?”

Momma said, “I sit on them for a full moon cycle.”

Georgia said, “You sat on them for 28 days, that is a long time.”

Just then 2 more ducklings appeared. Birch said, “There are now 4 ducklings and 5 eggs.”

Maple asked, “How do you get the ducklings to all hatch at the same time?”

Momma said, “I laid one egg each day for 9 days. But I did not sit on them at first. I made sure they did not freeze. But I only started keeping them really warm after I had laid all the eggs. That way, they all hatch at the same time!”

Two more ducklings hatched.

Birch said, “There are now 6 ducklings and 3 eggs.”

Georgia commented, ”Birch, you are good at counting.”

Another 2 eggs hatched, leaving just one more egg to hatch out. All the other ducklings were quacking happily. Maple asked Momma, “Can we help the duckling crack her shell?”

Momma said, “No. The duckling has to do it herself. If they are strong enough to crack the shell and get out, then they are strong enough to follow me down to the lake.” Everybody was waiting in anticipation. Finally, the duckling made a big peck from the inside and the shell cracked. All nine ducklings were now out.

Momma quacked and started waddling out from under the cabin and down to the lake.

The fearless foursome followed. Momma made her way to the end of the bay and jumped in. She kept quacking, calling to her ducklings. One by one they each jumped into the water and started to paddle.

The fearless foursome called out, “Good bye.”

They then each took a nibble of Boletus Maximus and returned to their usuals selves. Georgia, Dylan and Birch thanked Maple for keeping track of the days so that they could see this amazing sight.
