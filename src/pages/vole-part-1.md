In the secret lady slipper garden there were several types of special mushrooms. There was Boletus minimus - nibbling this would shrink one - a tiny nibble would shrink one to the size of a rabbit, a bigger nibble and one would be vole or mouse size and an even bigger nibble and one would shrink to the size of an ant! There was also Boletus Maximus that would restore one to one’s natural size. And an amazing thing happened when one shrunk to the size of smaller animals, one could understand what they were saying.

Georgia, Birch, Maple and Dylan went out to the secret lady slipper garden. Birch said “Let’s have a big nibble of the Boletus Minimus and shrink to the size of a vole.” Georgia said “Okay; do we each have some Boletus Maximus in our pocket?” Dylan, Maple and Birch said they did. Maple nibbled her mushroom and quickly shrunk to being 2” high. Birch said “Me too” and took a nibble. Then Dylan and when everyone had shrunk, Georgia took a big nibble and became vole sized too.

No one could see anyone else because tufts of moss and grass and small sticks were in the way. Maple called out, “where is everyone?” Birch said, “Stay there we will all come to you.” Dylan had to scramble over a large clump of moss. Birch climbed over some twigs and Georgia parted the grass and found Maple too. Birch said “Let’s stick together.” Maple said “Which way should we go.” Georgia said “Look for a runway in the grass and we will follow it.” Dylan found a tiny path and they all followed her. Soon it went into the ground and it became dark. Dylan said she couldn’t see. Maple said “I have a flashlight” and she turned it on and led the way deeper into the tunnel. Soon it opened up into a small room - it looked like there was a grass bed for sleeping in and there were tiny baby voles in the grass bedding. And there were seeds in another corner, a vole’s food supply. Just then a vole scurried in and looked them over. Dylan ran behind Georgia and looked through Georgia’s legs at the vole. Birch said “Hi - we are exploring - we would have knocked but there was no door to knock on.” The vole’s nose was twitching back and forth - eventually the vole decided they were not too dangerous. The Vole said “Please don’t shine that light in my eyes.” Maple said “I’m sorry” and aimed the light at the ceiling.

The vole went over the straw and started feeding the babies. Birch asked “Does the father bring you food?” The vole said “No - he is no help. I have to feed myself and feed the kids.” Good thing they grow up quickly - in a few days they will be on their own having to find their own food. Georgia asked “How will they know what to eat?” The vole said “They would learn quickly - they would taste things and if it seemed right they would eat it.” “And will they all live with you?” asked Dylan. “No” said the vole, “they will have to make a home of their own.” Birch asked “Are there many other voles?” The vole replied “There are not many voles around here - there’s just a few of us as there is not much food. Rumor has it that there is a great big castle somewhere near here. But I’ve never seen it. Some say lots of voles live there.” Maple wondered where it could be because she had never seen a castle on the island. Birch said “I wonder if the vole’s castle is our cabin?”

Georgia asked her “Do you get scared living by yourself?”

The vole said “I have to be careful when I go out to stay hidden in the grass as much as possible as I am scared of everything that is bigger than me - I have to be careful of falcons that will swoop at me from the sky. They seem to know where my paths are and I’ve lost brothers and sisters to falcons.” [Did you know that the vole urine shows up in ultraviolet colors that are visible to a falcon. A falcon will watch where voles have urinated - just hovering in the air waiting for a movement in the grass below.] The vole continued “So far I’ve been lucky. Have you ever seen a falcon?” The vole said they should be careful as, “they might want to eat you too!”

Dylan thought it was time to go. So Maple led the way. As they got close to the tunnel entrance, Georgia said they should all get their Boletus Maximus out so that they would take a bite as they stepped out of the tunnel, that way they would grow back to normal size before a falcon could pounce on them.

Birch said “That was close - did you see we scared that falcon away - that was a good plan Georgia.”

Maple said “That was scary but it was fun!”
