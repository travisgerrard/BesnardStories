When the fearsome foursome of Georgia, Birch, Dylan and Maple got back to the cabin, they discussed how they would find the vole castle.

Birch said “There is a vole family living in the hole in the tree by the gazebo. Let’s ask them.”

Dylan piped up “I’ll take a big nibble of the Boletus minimus. Georgia you can then pick me up and put me next to the hole to the vole family. I’ll go inside and ask them.”

Maple said “she would go to.”

So Maple and Dylan each took a big nibble. Birch put Maple in his hand and Georgia put Dylan in her hand. They lifted them up and Dylan and Maple peeked into the hole. It looked cozy. Dylan scrambled in and helped Maple down.

Birch and Georgia were on the outside. They put their ears to the hole, but because they were still big, they could not make out what all the squeaks were about.

In the nest was mother vole and 6 good sized children. [I am hoping that Birch and Maple can give me names for three of the them and Georgia and Dylan can provide names for the other three]The voles were all huddled in a corner wondering who these strange folk were.

Maple said “Don’t be afraid. We are friendly. We heard their was a castle nearby and we wanted to see it. Could you please show it to us.”

Momma vole thought this over. She said “My kids are just old enough to leave the nest and look after themselves. I’ll show everyone the castle, but stay with me. It is a big place and the giants set out traps for us that we have to avoid. Follow me.”

She looked out the hole and saw two giants! Dylan looked out the hole and said, those aren’t giants they are Georgia and Birch. They are friendly.”

Georgia and Birch put their hands up to the nest and Maple and Dylan jumped into them. Dylan turned to the mother and said, “If you jump into their hands, they will put us all onto the ground.”

Mother vole was very nervous. But the kids thought this would be great fun and they jumped onto their hands. Mother vole scrambled down the tree. Georgia and Birch put everyone on the ground beside mom and then they each took a big nibble of Boletus minimus and shrunk down to vole size.

Maple said “This is my big brother Birch. And that is my cousin Georgia.”

Mother vole said follow me, but stay under cover as much as possible as we don’t want a kestrel to swoop down and eat us!

To be continued as soon as I have names for the mouse children!
