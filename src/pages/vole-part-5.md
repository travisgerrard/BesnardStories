We left the fearless foursome in the roof of the castle. They had been looking through a hole in the floor of the roof at Stacey cooking supper. When they stopped looking and turned around, they found themselves all alone. Momma vole and her family had disappeared. Birch asked, “Where could they have gone?”

Maple asked “Why did they leave us?”

Dylan said “What do we do?”

Georgia said “Let’s go and ask the Sprucekins for help. Maybe they can show us their way in and out. They might know where momma vole went.”

Maple, with her flashlight flickering, led the way. Just then Birch’s friend Cook appeared.

Cook said “Hook played a naughty trick on us. Hook gave the signal for weasel and we scattered in all directions, so that the weasel would only catch one of us. There was no weasel and I do not know where everyone else is.”

Birch asked, “Do you think you could find your way out of the castle?”
Cook said “I might be able to. If I follow the strongest vole scent, I will be following the most used trail. I will try and follow our scent on the path we took up here.”

Dylan said “Wow, you sure have a good sniffer.”

With that Cook led and Birch, Maple, Dylan and Georgia followed.

Birch said “Slow down Cook, we can’t move as fast as you.” Cook slowed down till they caught up.

Just then Book came out of a side tunnel and asked Cook “Is it safe now? Where did the weasel go?”

Cook said, “There was no weasel. Hook was naughty. I am trying to find our way out.”

Book said, “Oh. I’ll join you.” Book scuttled along beside Maple.

Cook came to a spot where several tunnels came together. Cook said, “I think this tunnel has the strongest smell. What do you think Book?” Book agreed with Cook. Cook said, “Be careful, we are heading down now.”

Birch said, “This is steep. It is usually harder to go down than it is to go up. Maple did you bring any rope?”

Maple answered, “I did.”

Birch said, “We’ll tie ourselves together so if someone slips, the other three can steady the one who slipped.” They all tied themselves together in a chain. Birch led and Georgia went last as the anchor! Cook and Book used their sniffers to choose the path and they slowly descended.

Maple said, “This is easier than going up.” Georgia who was anchoring everybody and keeping all steady didn’t think so. But she kept that to herself. Her arms and shoulders were getting tired. Just then Teddy came out of the gloom and settled into the column beside Dylan and Georgia. Down and down they continued through the tunnel. Finally, they saw a light.
When they reached the entrance, the fearless foursome thanked Cook and Book for having such good sniffers and for finding their way out of the castle.

Georgia asked, “Have you ever had cheese?”

The voles replied, “No.”

Georgia said, “I know you will like cheese. We are going to have to leave you now. We will find some cheese and we will leave it for you at the entrance to the castle.” They saw that momma merganser was still sitting on her nest.

Maple asked, “When will your eggs hatch?”

Momma merganser quacked, “In eight days.”

Maple asked, “Could I come back in 8 days and see your ducklings hatch?”

Momma merganser quacked, “Yes.”

With that, the fearless foursome moved out from under the castle. They saw that there were no parents around. Georgia said they should all take a bite of Boletus Maximus. They did and were soon scampering into the “castle”, which was really their cabin and there was Stacey putting the finishing touches on the meal she was preparing!
