In the secret lady slipper garden there were several types of special mushrooms. There was Boletus minimus - nibbling this would shrink one - a tiny nibble would shrink one to the size of a rabbit, a bigger nibble and one would be vole or mouse size and an even bigger nibble and one would shrink to the size of an ant! There was also Boletus Maximus that would restore one to one’s natural size. And an amazing thing happened when one shrunk to the size of smaller animals, one could understand what they were saying.

There was a new beaver lodge on the north side of the island by Rocky Beach and Maple wanted to meet the beavers. She said “let’s go over to Rocky Beach and see if we can meet the beavers.”

Off went Birch, Maple, Dylan and Georgia. Georgia made sure that everybody had some Boletus Maximus in their pocket before each took a tiny nibble of the Boletus Minimus. Maple said, “Because we are only shrinking to rabbit or beaver size, we don’t need to hold onto a string this time. We should be able to see each other when we are smaller.”

No sooner had they shrunk than a beaver came up on the shore and started to chew on a poplar tree. His chewing teeth looked really big and fierce and Maple jumped behind Birch and Dylan jumped behind Georgia.

Georgia and Birch walked up to the Beaver. He stopped and looked at them and asked what they were.

Birch said “We live in a cabin on the other side of the island.”

The beaver said “I know the place. All the good trees have metal fences round them. Why is that?”

Georgia said “We like our trees and if we didn’t put a fence around them, you might cut them down.”

The beaver said “That is mighty unfriendly of you!”

Dylan asked “Why do you cut down more trees than you can eat?”

The beaver said “My chewing teeth are always growing. If I did not use them to cut down trees they would grow so big that I would not be able to chew and get food into my mouth.”

Birch said “We have lots of spruce trees but you never cut those down.”

The beaver said “I don’t like the taste of spruce. Poplar is my favorite and when I can’t get poplar, I will eat Birch, Alder and other similar trees, but never spruce, pine or fir. I like Maple too, but there is none growing around here.”

Maple said “It is a good thing he does not know your a B I R C H or that I am a M A P L E!” And she asked “What does your house or lodge look like inside?”

The beaver replied “My house is made of mud and logs. There is a tunnel that comes out under water. We are safe that way from coyotes and wolves as they can’t swim like we can and they are too big to get into our lodges. And because we have so many sticks in our lodge, they can’t dig down from the top to get at us.”

Georgia queried the beaver “What do you do in the winter.”

The beaver responded, I have to be busy in the summer and bury lots of branches and leaves under water near our lodge. When I am hungry I am then able to go out and have a snack. Winters are dark and long and for the most part, I will sleep.”

The beaver turned his back on them, and started to chew at the base of the poplar.

Georgia saw Nikki walking down the path. She said “Let’s hide and see what happens.” So they hid.

When the beaver saw Nikki, it slid into the water and gave the water a mighty splash with its tail. There was a resounding crack and the beaver disappeared under water. Nikki continued walking down the trail.

After she had passed Maple said “Let’s eat the Boletus Maximus now.” They did and they were soon their regular selves again.
