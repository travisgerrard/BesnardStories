We left the fearless foursome of Birch, Maple, Dylan and Georgia at the base of the dead tree with the vole nest. They were with the vole mother and her 6 offspring - Book, Cook, Hook, Tubby, Teddy and Meo. Book and Maple connected as did Cook and Birch. Dylan liked Teddy and Georgia paired up with Tubby. Meo and Hook set off together. A squirrel chattered loudly; mother vole said "That is a warning signal; evryone seek shelter in the large cavern." The cavern was very roomy and open on all sides. It was amazingly square shaped and was some 50 vole lengths across in both directions. They made their way to the eastern end of the cavern. The squirrels had stopped their chattering - momma vole looked out and said "The coast is clear."

There was a fir tree that was spreading out close to the ground. Momma said "This would provide good cover." So they all scurried after momma under the fir tree. She then said "When I say go, run as fast as you can to that raspberry patch and we will regroup there.“ "Go." Birch and Cook took off quickly, closely followed by Maple and Book. Dylan and Teddy were next and Georgia and Tubby followed behind Dylan making sure she arrived safely. Hook and Meo dilly dallied - a sharp shinned hawk swooped down - Hook dodged but Meo wasn't so fortunate. After they had regrouped, Momma said "Hook, follow directions or that may be your fate next." Dylan said "I am scared, this is dangerous." Georgia comforted her “I’ll protect you. “ Birch said “And I have a knife.”

Momma said "Cross the path and we will regroup under the gooseberry bush. Hook you stay with me” They wound their way under the bush avoiding all the spikes. Momma said "Spikes are good as they keep our enemies at bay." When they got to the other side, Momma said “there is the castle.” They all stared at this amzingly large structure that was some 250 vole lengths wide and some 40 vole lengths high. It was awesome.

They scurried across another path and under the castle. There they met Momma Merganser who was sitting on 12 eggs. Momma vole said "She is friendly. she fishes for minnows in the ocean when she is hungry. She has been keeping her eggs warm for 2 weeks now and her eggs should hatch in about 10 days time. If you are still here, we can watch the chicks hatching.“ Momma said "I hope you are good climbers because it is a long ways up to the top of the castle. When we get to the top, we can see all the way across the ocean to the far shore."

There was a rock face that was some 5 vole lengths high. Birch said "It is a good thing that dad has taught us how to climb." Momma scurried up the rock face with ease. "Wow" said Dylan. Birch gave Maple, Dylan and Georgia a lift to get them started. They then scrambled up using their fingers and toes - inserting them into small cracks in the rock - eventually getting up to the bottom of the castle. The next part was very tricky - they had to get round a large tree or beam. They followed momma - over the ages the voles had made a path which was easier for the voles to climb than it was for Goergia, Birch, Dylan and Maple. Momma said "We now have to go single file up a long winding staricase. It is dark - we voles have whiskers that detect the sides of the staircase.“ Maple said "I don't need whiskers because I have a flashlight to show me the way."
